A simple physics game using Box2D. Classes used to interface with Box2D (ie World, Object) may be of use to others.

Depends on SDL, OpenGL, Box2D, and gtest. The Makefile has an explicit -L directive for linking with Box2D specific to my Box2D installation -- should be modified for other machines.
